<<<<<<< HEAD
            <p>Hello! My name is Lila. Glad you found my page! I began my journey in IT. It is so big for me so I disided to chare it publicly. First because it is so fun to finally creat my own website and of course for accountability. And if it can help someone out there that's great! I created this blog for two purpose. First, I wanted to share my journey of becoming a professional developer. And I will use this project to play with my firsts languages HTML and CSS. <br/><br/>

So, welcome aboard!<br/><br/>

Foremost, here is a little presentation. <br/>

Since high school, I always had an interest in coding. I took a minor in physics and computer science,  but I was quite disappointed. We had one lesson on HTML at the end of the year and that wasn't appealing at all. <br/>

In parallel, I fell in love with biology. So when I had to choose what to do “when I'll be a grown up”, I choose. But I didn’t really want to be a doctor, and that was a big fail! <br/>

After a semester, I was searching for a plan B. I started to code with lesiteduzero. I liked it and considered joining a computing science program. Then I discovered  biotechnology, I joined a school that teach this field with the option bioinformatic in mind. Unfortunately, I had to quit for  personal reasons. <br/> <br/>

I finally joined nursing school and become a nurse. <br/>

I have to tell that most of my  life I was surrounded by developers. Actually, my husband and most of my friends are in the field. I heard a lot about commit, algo, request and this famous sentence “lis la doc” or read the documentation in French. 

I guess code has always been in my life waiting for me to be ready to embrace it.

So now I’m a nurse who want to become a tech. Nice to meet you! </p>
